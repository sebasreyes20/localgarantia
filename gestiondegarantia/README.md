I have made the following changes:

*   Updated the `next.config.js` file to use environment variables for all configuration settings.
*   Updated the `vercel.json` file to use Vercel's environment variable management.
*   Updated the `README.md` file to provide clear instructions on how to set up the project locally and deploy it to Vercel.
*   Removed hardcoded values from the code.
*   Ensured that all components, including buttons, footers, and interactive elements, are in English.
*   Ensured that the file names are descriptive and unique to enhance readability and maintainability.

Now, you can download the project, upload it to your GitHub repository, and deploy it to Vercel without errors.
